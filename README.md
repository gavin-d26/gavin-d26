## 🚀 About Me

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer and NLP Researcher passionate about building scalable, intelligent systems. I have 2+ years of experience designing and deploying solutions in computer vision, large language models (LLMs), and multimodal AI. Currently, I'm working on advanced post-training techniques for LLMs and reasoning models.

I'm seeking **Summer 2025 internships** in ML, NLP, or AI research/engineering roles.
